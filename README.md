# Fast Food Nutrition | Data Analysis using RStudio
## Introduction
In this project, we analyze the Fast Food Nutrition dataset to explore the relationship between various nutritional components in fast food items and investigate their potential impact on public health. The dataset includes information on calories, fat, carbohydrates, and other nutritional facts for various fast food items from multiple chains. Our main objective is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develop a regression model to understand how certain factors influence calories and other variables.

We'll focus on answering the following research questions:

### What are the main drivers of calorie content in fast food items?
### Is there a statistically significant relationship between the fat content and calorie count?
### How do nutritional components, such as carbohydrates and protein, correlate with calories?


## Key Observations:
**1.    Calories and Total Fat (0.841):**
There is a strong positive correlation between calories and total fat. This suggests that as the total fat content increases, the calorie content tends to increase as well, indicating that high-fat foods generally have high caloric content.

**2.    Calories and Protein (0.742):**
There is also a significant positive correlation between calories and protein. Higher protein foods tend to have higher calorie counts, suggesting that protein-rich fast foods may also be calorically dense.

**3.    Total Fat and Protein (0.806):**
A strong positive correlation exists between total fat and protein. This implies that items with more total fat also tend to have higher protein content, which is common in many fast food items that combine fats and proteins (e.g., cheeseburgers).

**4.    Sodium and Total Fat (0.821):**
There is a strong positive correlation between sodium and total fat. This suggests that foods with higher fat content often contain higher sodium levels, possibly due to processing methods that enhance flavor.

**5.    Calories and Sodium (0.731):**
There is a substantial positive correlation between calories and sodium. Foods that are higher in calories are likely to be higher in sodium, which is common in many fast food items that prioritize flavor.

**6.    Carbohydrates and Other Nutrients:**
Carbohydrates show weak correlations with total fat, protein, and sodium (ranging from 0.14 to 0.17). This suggests that carbohydrate content does not strongly influence the other nutritional components in the same way fat and protein do.

**7.    Overall Insights:**
Foods that are high in calories are typically high in total fat and protein, as well as sodium. However, carbohydrates do not exhibit strong correlations with these variables, indicating that fast food items may vary in their carbohydrate content independently of fat, protein, and sodium levels.
